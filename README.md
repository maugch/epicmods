Check mods for games on Epic Games Shop

This program will allow you to check for updates on mods of games installed with the Epic Games Launcher/Shop.

It uses Steam Games Worshop to check for updates. Unfortunately there aren't any other method yet as long as modders keep to upload them only there.

This program is not able to download the mods, it only helps you check if you need new version and helps installing them.

Beta version. It does save a backup of an old version, as long as it recognize them. You need to store them in a directory named after the ID of the mod.

Run client.py and add all packages needed. (requests, beautifulsoup and lxml)
